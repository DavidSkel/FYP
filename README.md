# Maths App For Practising Relations In Sets

By UP2047589

## Introduction

This project was developed for my Final Year Project as part of the Computer Science course at the University of Portsmouth.
This code creates questions for Reflexive, Transitive and Symmetric relations in sets and allows the user to choose an answer.
The code then will respond to the users answer appropriatly whether a corect or incorrect solution was chosen before displaying the correct solution.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12.0
* Flutter 3.16.9
* Dart 3.2.6
* Windows Device capable of running Flutter
* IDE capable of running Flutter (e.g. Visual Studio Code)

## Dependencies

This program depends on Python Flask

Install Flask using the Command Promt

**Installation Using Pip:**

`pip install Flask`

## Usage

- Download project folder and extract the project from the zip folder.
- Open the project folder into the chosen IDE.
- When prompted run `pub get` to download required dependancies inside the project.
- Set the device Flutter will load the project in to `Windows` as currently the code only functions on Windows devices. In Visual Studio Code, the Windows device option would look similar to <code>Windows <quote>windows - desktop</quote></code>
- Navigate to the Python file named `app.py` and run it, this starts the Flask server which is required for the project to function. The terminal in the IDE should say when if the server is running. The `app.py` file can be located at the file path of `"FYP-main\lib\python_code\app.py"`
- Navigate to the Dart file named `main.dart` and execute it. This will start the Flutter part of the code and display the application visually. The `main.dart` file can be located at the file path of `"FYP-main\lib\main.dart"`
